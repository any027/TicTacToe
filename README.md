# TicTacToe
A console Tic Tac Toe game made for an interview coded in Python.

Currently supports going first or going second, but the computer is still a random player.
Considering researching to make an unbeatable AI.

To play, simply have both files in a directory and run 
python TicTacToe.py

Beta  Version.
